## Semantic Code Search (jbcontext)

You have access to `jbcontext search` for searching the codebase semantically.
Use the `/context-search` skill or run `jbcontext search "<query>"` to find code by meaning, not just keywords.

### Single-Shot Policy

Use `jbcontext search` as a semantic bootstrap when the relevant file or subsystem is still unknown.

- If no relevant file is open yet, start with one `jbcontext search`.
- Make the first query specific to the issue's named feature, class, method, config flag, or behavior when available.
- After the first search, open at least one returned file and inspect it locally.
- If the first hit is relevant but incomplete, inspect neighboring files locally in that same directory or subsystem before any semantic retry.
- After the first relevant file or path is known, prefer direct file reads and exact search to inspect nearby code.
- If a semantic retry is still needed, use `jbcontext search -p <path> ...` with the directory of the best first hit.
